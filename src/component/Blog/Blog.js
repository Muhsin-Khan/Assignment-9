                Block-level Elements. A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available. An inline element does not start on a new line and it only takes up as much width as necessary,A block element has some whitespace above and below it and does not tolerate any HTML elements next to it. An inline-block element is placed as an inline element (on the same line as adjacent content), but it behaves as a block element.
